I don't know that it always makes me more efficient, but I do like to see how much of my day to day
computer usage can be done completely with the keyboard.  One thing that has always vexed me a bit is 
managing window layouts.   

I played with [moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) for a while, and really liked it in general, but I wanted something with a little more oomph.  I ran into [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) and started playing around with it.  The barrier to entry is fairly high (config is purely a text file) but it's not terrible if you're used to config files. 

I've got a particular window layout I like to use when I'm writing code. I'm also not particularly careful about maintaining the window position (I move things around as my focus shifts).  What I wanted was some way to easily reset back to my preferred window layout.  So, I used slate to map cmd-ctrl-a to:

- launch Sublimetext
- launch iTerm
- launch SourceTree, 
- Move iTerm to the left, full height
- Move Sublimetext to the right, full height
- Move SourceTree to the left most area on my 2nd monitor.

You can see a video of slate in action below.

So, no matter how much I move stuff around, cmd-ctrl-a will snap everything back (launching it as needed) to 
where I want it.
