I don't know that it always makes me more efficient, but I do like to see how much of my day to day
computer usage can be done completely with the keyboard.  One thing that has always vexed me a bit is 
managing window layouts.   

I've got a particular window layout I like to use when I'm writing code.  I also occasionally like to move
windows around as I need to focus on different things (browser, terminal, editor, etc), but, I do most of 
my work with a particular layout.  I have cmd-ctrl-a mapped to:

- launch Sublimetext
- launch iTerm
- launch SourceTree, 
- Move iTerm to the left, full height
- Move Sublimetext to the right, full height
- Move SourceTree to the left most area on my 2nd monitor.

You can see a video of slate in action below.
