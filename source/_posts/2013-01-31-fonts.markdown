Occasionally I like to try new fonts.  
{% img right /images/source_code_pro_font.png Source Code Pro in use %}

I ran into a neat comparison at [slant.co](http://slant.co/topics/what-is-the-best-programming-font) of various mono-spaced fonts for programming.  Since I like to try new things I figured I'd give "Source Code Pro" a shot.  I ended up downloading the OTF files from [here](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-code-pro) which made the install a bit easier.  To install:

1. [Download](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-code-pro) the OTF files
2. Unzip the fonts
3. Launch the Font Book application
4. Drag the otf files into font book

Now you should be able to use the font.  It works well as a terminal font, but I prefer it for editing.  


**Configuring Sublimetext2**

In order to activate your new font in SublimeText2 add the following to your user config (adjust font_size to your liking)

    "font_face": "Source Code Pro",
    "font_size": 14
