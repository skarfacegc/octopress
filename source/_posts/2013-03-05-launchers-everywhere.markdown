I'm a huge fan of launchers like [quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/), [alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/), [spotlight](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2531), [launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html), etc.  I've been using one since I got my first mac.  I'm currently using [launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) (which will likely end up being another post).
If you've ever used one, you know how nice it is to avoid using the mouse occasionally.

While I used various launchers constantly, I had never run into one baked into an application.  Enter [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/).  Wow.  The command palette is awesome.  No more hunting through menus or trying to remember a few dozen keyboard shortcuts.   âŒ˜-shift-p brings up the command palette.  Start typing what you want to do and hit enter. 

Rather than hunting through menus or trying to map shortcuts, I just type what I want to do, and most of the time it works.  What would be extra neat, is if applications could publish their keywords to a system wide launcher.  The system wide launcher would be aware of what has focus and provide access to those keywords.
